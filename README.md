This package is meant to be used with the Rubin DM team's [`ctrl_bps_parsl`](https://github.com/lsst/ctrl_bps_parsl) plugin to their [Batch Production Service](https://github.com/lsst/ctrl_bps) execution framework for running the Rubin pipelines at scale.  This package contains a site configuration class that uses Parsl's `WorkQueueExecutor`, `SlurmProvider` classes to manage pipeline jobs running on a slurm cluster, such as the Perlmutter system at NERSC.
